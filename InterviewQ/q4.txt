For example, given strings A and B such that:


 A = "abcd,aabc,bd"


 B = "aaa,aa"


the function should return [3, 2], because:


All the strings in the array are strictly smaller than "aaa" on the basis of the given comparison criteria;


Strings "abcd" and "bd" are strictly smaller than "aa".


Assume that:

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10000

1 ≤ length of any string contained by A or B ≤ 10

All the input strings comprise only lowercase English alphabet letters (a-z)


In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the primary focus of the assessment.
